First-order Circuit

> A first-order circuit is characterized by a first-order differential equation.

We carry out the analysis of *RC* and *RL* circuits by applying Kirchhoff’s laws, as we did for resistive circuits. The only difference is that applying Kirchhoff’s laws to purely resistive circuits results in algebraic equations, while applying the laws to *RC* and *RL* circuits produces differential equations, which are more difficult to solve than algebraic equations. The differential equations resulting from analysing *RC* and *RL* circuits are of the first order. Hence, the circuits are collectively known as *first-order* circuits.

**The Source-Free *RC* Circuit**

A source-free *RC* circuit occurs when its dc source is suddenly dis- connected. The energy already stored in the capacitor is released to the resistors.

<center>Figure 4.1</center>

the voltage response of the *RC* circuit is an exponential decay of the initial voltage. Since the response is due to the initial energy stored and the physical characteristics of the circuit and not due to some external voltage or current source, it is called the *natural response* of the circuit.
$$
v ( t ) = V _ { 0 } e ^ { - t / R C }
$$
The natural response is illustrated graphically in Fig. 4.2. Note that at *t* = 0, we have the correct initial condition as in Eq. above. As *t* increases, the voltage decreases toward zero. The rapidity with which the voltage decreases is expressed in terms of the *time constant*, denoted by t, the lowercase Greek letter tau.

> The time constant of a circuit is the time required for the response to decay to a factor of 1/􏱹*e* or 36.8 percent of its initial value.

$$
v ( t ) = V _ { 0 } e ^ { - t / \tau }
$$

The switch in the circuit in Fig. 4.5 has been closed for a long time, and it is opened at *t* =0. Find *v*(*t*) for *t*>0. Calculate the initial energy stored in the capacitor.

<center>Figure 4.5</center>

**Solution:**

For *t* <0, the switch is closed; the capacitor is an open circuit to dc, as represented in Fig. 4.6 (a). Using voltage division
$$
v _ { c } ( t ) = \frac { 9 } { 9 + 3 } ( 20 ) = 15 V , \quad t < 0
$$
Since the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, the voltage across the capacitor at *t*  (0+) is the same at *t* (0-) , or
$$
v _ { c } ( 0 ) = V _ { 0 } = 15 V
$$

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.6.png" style="zoom:80%;" />
<center>Figure 4.6</center>

For *t* >0, the switch is opened, and we have the *RC* circuit shown in Fig. 4.6 (b). [Notice that the *RC* circuit in Fig. 4.6 (b)is source free; the independent source in Fig. 4.5 is needed to provide *V*0 or the initial energy in the capacitor.] The 1Ω and 9Ω  resistors in series give
$$
R _ { eq } = 1 + 9 = 10 \Omega
$$
The time constant is
$$
\tau = R _ { eq } C = 10 \times 20 \times 10 ^ { - 3 } = 0.2 s
$$
Thus, the voltage across the capacitor for *t* > 0 is
$$
v ( t ) = v _ { c } ( 0 ) e ^ { - t / \tau } = 15 e ^ { - t / 0.2 } V
$$
The initial energy stored in the capacitor is
$$
w _ { c } ( 0 ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } C v _ { c } ^ { 2 } ( 0 ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \times 20 \times 10 ^ { - 3 } \times 15 ^ { 2 } = 2.25 J
$$
**Step Response of an *RC* Circuit**

> The step response of a circuit is its behaviour when the excitation is the step function, which may be a voltage or a current source.

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.7.png" style="zoom:80%;" />
<center>Figure 4.7</center>

$$
v ( t ) = V _ { s } + ( V _ { 0 } - V _ { s } ) e ^ { - t / \tau } , \quad t > 0
$$

The current through the capacitor is obtained by using ，
$$
i(t) =C\frac{dv}{dt}
$$

$$
i ( t ) = C \frac { d v } { d t } = \frac { C } { \tau } V _ { s } e ^ { - t / \tau } , \quad \tau = R C , \quad t > 0
$$


The first decomposition of the complete response is in terms of the source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of the permanency of the responses. Under certain conditions, the natural response and transient response are the same. The same can be said about the forced response and steady-state response. Whichever way we look at it, the complete response may be written as
$$
v ( t ) = v ( \infty ) + [ v ( 0 ) - v ( \infty ) ] e ^ { - t / \tau }
$$
Thus, to find the step response of an *RC* circuit requires three things:

> 1. The initial capacitor voltage *v*(0). 
>
> 2. The final capacitor voltage *v*(infinity). 
> 3. The time constant t.

The switch in Fig. 4.9 has been in position *A* for a long time. At *t*=0, the switch moves to *B*. Determine *v*(*t*) for *t* > 0 and calculate its value at *t* = 1 s and 4 s.

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.9.png" style="zoom:80%;" />
<center>Figure 4.9</center>

**Solution:**

For *t* < 0, the switch is at position *A*. The capacitor acts like an open circuit to dc, but *v* is the same as the voltage across the 5kΩ resistor. Hence, the voltage across the capacitor just before *t* =0 is obtained by voltage division as
$$
v ( 0 ^ { - } ) = \frac { 5 } { 5 + 3 } ( 24 ) = 15 V
$$
Using the fact that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously,
$$
v ( 0 ) = v ( 0 ^ { - } ) = v ( 0 ^ { + } ) = 15 V
$$
For *t* > 0, the switch is in position *B*. The Thevenin resistance connected to the capacitor is *R*th = 4 kΩ, and the time constant is
$$
\tau = R _ { Th } C = 4 \times 10 ^ { 3 } \times 0.5 \times 10 ^ { - 3 } = 2 s
$$
Since the capacitor acts like an open circuit to dc at steady state,
$$
v ( \infty ) =30 V
$$
Thus,
$$
\left. { v ( t ) = v ( \infty ) + [ v ( 0 ) - v ( \infty ) ] e ^ { - t / \tau } }\\{ = 30 + ( 15 - 30 ) e ^ { - t / 2 } = ( 30 - 15 e ^ { - 0.5 t } ) V } \right.
$$
At *t* =1,
$$
v ( 1 ) = 30 - 15 e ^ { - 0.5 } = 20.9 V
$$
At *t* =4,
$$
v ( 4 ) = 30 - 15 e ^ { - 2 } = 27.97 V
$$
