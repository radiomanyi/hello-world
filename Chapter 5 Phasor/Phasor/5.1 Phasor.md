> A phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid.

A complex number z can be written in rectangular form as,
$$
z = x + j y
$$
*x* is the real part of *z*; *y* is the imaginary part of *z*. In this context, the variables *x* and *y* do not represent a location as in two-dimensional vector analysis but rather the real and imaginary parts of *z* in the complex plane. Nevertheless, we note that there are some resemblances between manipulating complex numbers and manipulating two-dimensional vectors.

The complex number *z* can also be written in polar or exponential form as 
$$
z = r  \angle \phi = r e ^ { j \phi }
$$
The relationship between the rectangular form and the polar form is shown in Fig. 4.10, where the *x* axis represents the real part and the *y* axis represents the imaginary part of a complex number. Given *x* and *y*, we can get *r* and f as

$$
r = \sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } } , \quad \phi = \tan ^ { - 1 } \frac { y } { x }
$$

Given a sinusoid
$$
v ( t ) = V _ { m } \cos ( \omega t + \phi )
$$
we obtain the corresponding phasor as 
$$
V = V_m  \angle \phi
$$

Transform these sinusoids to phasors:
$$
\left. { i = 6 \cos ( 50 t - 40 ^ { \circ } ) A } \\ { v = - 4 \sin ( 30 t + 50 ^ { \circ } ) V } \right.
$$
(a) 
$$
I = 6 \angle - 40 ^ { \circ } A
$$
(b)
$$
\left. { - \sin A = \cos ( A + 90 ^ { \circ } ) }\\{ v = - 4 \sin ( 30 t + 50 ^ { \circ } ) = 4 \cos ( 30 t + 50 ^ { \circ } + 90 ^ { \circ } ) }\\{ = 4 \cos ( 30 t + 140 ^ { \circ } ) V } \right.
$$
Thus, the phasor form of *v* is
$$
V = 4 \angle 140 ^ { \circ } V
$$
