Thevenin’s theorem provides a technique by which the fixed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit.

> Thevenin’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source *V*Th in series with a resistor *R*Th, where *V*Th is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals and *R*Th is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.

 Let us find out what will make the two circuits in Fig. 4.23 equivalent. If the ter- minals *a*-*b* are made open-circuited (**by removing the load**), no current flows, so that the open-circuit voltage across the terminals *a*-*b* in Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to the voltage source *V*Th in Fig. 4.23(b), since the two circuits are equivalent. Thus *V*Th is the **open-circuit voltage** across the terminals as shown in Fig. 4.24(a); that is,

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.24.png" style="zoom:70%;" />

$$
V_{th} = V_{oc}
$$

Again, with the load disconnected and terminals *a*-*b* open- circuited, we turn off all independent sources. The input resistance (or equivalent resistance) of the dead circuit at the terminals *a*-*b* in Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to *R*Th in Fig. 4.23(b) because the two circuits are equivalent. Thus, *R*Th is the input resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b); that is,
$$
R_{th} = R_{in}
$$
Example 4.8 

Find the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.27, to the left of the terminals *a*-*b*. Then find the current through RL= 6, 16, and 36􏰅Ohm.

Solution:

We find *R*Th by turning off the 32-V voltage source (replacing it with a short circuit) and the 2-A current source (replacing it with an open circuit). The circuit becomes what is shown in Fig. 4.28(a). Thus,

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.28.png" style="zoom:70%;" />

$$
R_{th} = 4||12 + 1 = \frac{4\times12}{16} +1 =4 \Omega
$$

To find *V*Th, consider the circuit in Fig. 4.28(b). Applying mesh analysis to the two loops, we obtain
$$
-32 +4i_1+12(i_1 - i_2) = 0, i_2 = -2A
$$
Solving for *i*1, we get *i*1 􏰀 0.5 A. Thus,
$$
V_{th} = 12(i_1 -i_2) = 12(0.5 +2) =30V
$$
Alternatively, it is even easier to use nodal analysis. We ignore the 1-􏰅 resistor since no current flows through it. At the top node, KCL gives
$$
\frac{32-V_{th}}{4} + 2 = \frac{V_{th}}{12}\\
V_{th} =30V
$$
The Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 4.29.  

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.29.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

The current through Rl is
$$
I_{L} = \frac{V_{th}}{V_{th}+V_{L}} =\frac{30}{4 + R_{L}}
$$
