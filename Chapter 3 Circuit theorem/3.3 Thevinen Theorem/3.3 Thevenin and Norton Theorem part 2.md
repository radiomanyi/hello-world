##### Norton’s Theorem

> Norton’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source *IN* in parallel with a resistor *RN*, where *IN* is the short-circuit current through the terminals and *RN* is the input or equivalent resistance at the termi- nals when the independent sources are turned off.

Thus, the circuit in Fig. 4.37(a) can be replaced by the one in Fig. 4.37(b). The proof of Norton’s theorem will be given in the next section. For now, we are mainly concerned with how to get *RN* and *IN*. We find *RN* in the same way we find *R*Th. In fact, from what we know about source transformation, **the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal.**

Example 4.11 Find the Norton equivalent circuit of the circuit in Fig. 4.39 at terminals *a*-*b*.

**Solution:**

We find *RN* in the same way we find *RTh* in the Thevenin equivalent circuit. Set the independent sources equal to zero. This leads to the circuit in Fig. 4.40(a), from which we find *RN*. Thus,
$$
R_N =5 ||(8+4+8) =5 ||20 =4 \Omega
$$

To find *IN*, we short-circuit terminals *a* and *b*, as shown in Fig. 4.40(b). ***<u>We ignore the 5Ohm-􏰅 resistor because it has been short-circuited.</u>*** Applying mesh analysis, we obtain
$$
i_1 = 2A,\\
20i_2 - 4i_1 -12 = 0
$$

From these equations, we obtain
$$
i_2 = 1A = i_{sc} = I_N
$$
**Alternatively**, we may determine *IN* from *VTh*􏱹 *RTh*. We obtain *VTh* as the open-circuit voltage across terminals *a* and *b* in Fig. 4.40(c). Using mesh analysis, we obtain

$$
i_3 = 2A\\
25i_4 -4i_3 -12 = 0 => i_4 = 0.8 A
$$

and
$$
v_{oc} = v_{th} = 5i_4 = 4V
$$
Hence,
$$
I_N = \frac{V_{th}}{R_{th}} = 1 A
$$
as obtained previously. Thus, the Norton equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 4.41.
