> A source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source Vs in series with a resistor R by a current source Is in parallel with a resistor R or vice versa.

$$
V_s = I_sR
\\or\\
I_s = \frac{V_s}{R}
$$

Use source transformation to find v0 om the circuit of Fig. 4.17.

Solution:

We first transform the current and voltage sources to obtain the circuit in Fig. 4.18(a). 

Combining the 4- Ωand 2- Ω resistors in series and transforming the 12-V voltage source gives us Fig. 4.18(b).

 We now combine the 3- Ω and 6-Ω  resistors in parallel to get 2-Ω . We also combine the 2-A and 4-A current sources to get a 2-A source. Thus, by repeatedly applying source transformations, we obtain the circuit in Fig. 4.18(c).

We use current division in Fig. 4.18(c) to get
$$
i = \frac{2}{2+8}(2) = 0.4 A\\
and\\
v_0 =8 i =8(0.4) =3.2V
$$
