##### Linear property

> Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship between effect and result.

1. If the current is increased by a constant k, then the voltage increases correspondingly by k, that is,

$$
kiR =kV
$$

2. The addivity property requires that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of responses to each input applied seperately. Using the voltage-current relationship of a resistor, if

$$
v_{1} = i_{1}R
$$

<div style="text-align:left">and </div>

$$
v_{2} = i_{2}R
$$

The applying of (i1 + i2) gives
$$
v = (i_{1} + i_{2})R = i_{1}R+i_{2}R = v_{1} +v_{2}
$$

##### Superposition

The idea of superposition rests on the linearity property.

> The superposition states that the voltage across an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across(or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone.

Steps to apply Superposition principle

1. Turn off all independent sources except one source. Find the output due to that active source using the techniques covered in Chapters 2 and 3.
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the other independent sources.
3. Find the total contribution by adding algebraically all the contributions due to the independent sources.

> Superposition does help reduce a complex circuit to a simpler circuit through replacement of voltage sources by short circuits and of current sources by open circuit.

Example 4.3

Use the superposition theorem to find v in the circuit of. Fig. 4.6.

Solution:

Since there are two sources, let
$$
v = v_{1} + v_{2}
$$
When v1 and v2  are the contributions due to the  6-V voltage source and the 3-A current source, respectively. To obtain v1, we set the current source to zero, as shown in Fig. 4.7(a).

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.7(a).png" style="zoom:50%;" />

 Applying KVL to the loop in Fig. 4.7(a) gives
$$
12i_{1} - 6 = 0 --> i_{1} =0.5 A
$$
Thus 
$$
v_{1} = 4i_{1} = 2V
$$
We may also use voltage division to get v1 by writing
$$
v_{1} = \frac{4}{4+8}(6) =2V
$$
To get v2, we must set the voltage source to zero, as in Fig 4.7(b). Using current division.

<div align=center><img src="Figure 4.7(b).png" style="zoom:50%;" />
<center>Figure 4.7(b) </center>

$$
i_{3} = \frac{4}{4+8}(3) = 2A
$$
Hence,
$$
v_{2} =4i_{3}= 8V
$$
And we find
$$
v = v_{1} +v_{2} = 2+8 =10V
$$
