GitHub tutorials for WXIT-AIT Computer Engineering Class (CES31981-WXIT)
>It is recommended that all the assignments are uploaded with this platform.
Hi, I am Yi Ping, the tutor of your module Interface Electronics,
I'd like to introduce this online tool as our Hub for learning,
You will cultivate a manner of logical thinking and scientific behavior in your future learning.

In this Interface Electronics Modules, we will learn 

- DC and AC Circuits
- Diodes and Transistors
- Basic digital components
- Power electronics

Meanwhile, we will introduce basic skills like print circuit board design(Altium Designer 2020), software simulation(Multisim and Proteus),  Micro-controller basics.

Later in this semester, we will take the lab session to deep our understanding of theoretical part of electronics and by making projects you will enhance the practical ability.
