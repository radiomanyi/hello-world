### The concept of electric circuit

simple mode: battery, lamp and connecting wires

complicated mode: a radio receiver (two stages of amplification)

### basic elements

Current:  电荷 charge（Q 单位 coulomb） 电流 current（i 单位ampere） 之前的关系，单位时间内电荷的变化程度。
$$
i=\frac{dq}{dt}
$$

$$
Q=\int_{t0}^{t}{i}dt
$$

A direct current is a current that remains constant with time.

An alternating current is  a current that varies sinusoid ally with time .

***

Voltage: It is the energy required to move a unit charge through an element, measured in volts(V).
$$
Vab=\frac{dw}{dq}
$$
potential 电动势 

The plus（+） and minus（-） are used to define reference direction or voltage polarity.

> 正号和负号用于定义参考方向或电压极性。

***

Power and energy: Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in  watts(W).
$$
p=\frac{dw}{dt}
$$
Current direction and voltage polarity plays a major role in determining the sign of power.

> 电流和电压的方向决定了功率的符号。（吸收功率或者发出功率）

### Circuit elements

Source 电源 Ideal independent source| Dependent(Controlled) source

Example:

Power supplied equals the total power absorbed.

### Problem solving

1. Carefully define the problem.
2. Present everything you know about the problem.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that promises the greatest like hood of success.
4. Attempt a problem solution.
5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily?

Solve for the current flowing through the 8Ω resistor in Fig. 1.19.

$$
answer： i8Ω=0.25A
$$
It is flowing down through the 8-Ω resistor.

Today I will give you another assignment to do.
